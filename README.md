 Commit your affairs to the Lord, and your plans will be established.

[![App Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexatridecimal/learnNikud/main/graphics/mock_v3.webp)](https://app.moqups.com/uEk2UmZw30/view)

Over 1 year in development! 🎉 Give our [updated interactive
wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/uEk2UmZw30/view) a try, or read the
[Learn Nikud Lesson Plans](https://github.com/hexatridecimal/learnNikud/raw/main/data/lesson_plans/Learn%20Nikud%20-%20Lesson%20Plans.odt).
Welcome to Learn Nikud, When I was 12 years old I tried to teach myself
Hebrew and failed. I didn't have a rabbi or anyone to teach me. At the
time I didn't even know I was Jewish because our family had been
assimilated into Christian society many years before. As an adult I
tried again and I and realized there is no nikud learning app
available free. There are great free apps to learn the Hebrew aleph-bet
such as [Write
It-Hebrew](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/write-it-hebrew/id1400944424)
but there is no 100% free app for lerning nikud. Wouldn't it be amazing
if there was a professional quality free app that would teach a new
Hebrew learner from the aleph-bet to dovening in a month or less? This
way young people like me would never go without a free teacher ever
again!

That is the ultimate vision of this software and repository. The first
goal is leanring nikud since this is the single biggest missing piece.
A learner can use [Learn Trope](http://learntrope.com/) to learn the
dovening portion, and I already mentioned one of many for learning the
shapes or sounds of the aleph-bet. So this is the first and most critical
missing piece in the free ecosystem. There is nothing more precious
than teaching the Leshon Hakodesh! Let's make something wonderful!

# Development Stages

## 1. Development Planning (✅)

```
  מַחְשְׁב֣וֹת חָ֖רוּץ אַךְ־לְמוֹתָ֑ר וְכָל־אָ֜֗ץ אַךְ־לְמַחְסֽוֹר
  The plans of a diligent man lead only to advantage, whereas every hasty
    one hurries only to want.
  - Mishle 21:5
```

### Understanding The Audience

The intended audience is Jews of all ages who are learning Hebrew for the
first time. This will be the primary and first intended audience, there
are many interested people who are not Jewish who may find it useful.
Many of the diaspora of Israel are awaking and rediscovering their holy
language. Interntionalization will be a central and fundamental goal of
this software from the ground up.

### Wireframe Design

[View the Interactive Wireframe v3](https://app.moqups.com/uEk2UmZw30/view)

### Design Consideration

There will be 4 different apps using this same software as a base. The
first one is Learn Nikud. But the learning program will be:

1. Learn Aleph-Bet
2. Learn Nikud (first priority)
3. Learn Trope
4. Learn Tefillos

In order to allow the widest possible audience design consideration will
be given to internationalization (i18n) to allow multiple language
content to be displayed using the same UI/UX. And the download size of
the final application will need to be minimized to allow the highest
access for user content while maintaining quality.

Many families will have multiple children or family members who will
want to sahre the same device. So a basic student account system is a
core feature. This is a simple passwordless design used to store student
progress.

Each lesson will be preceding by a full-screen vertical format mobile
video lesson containing animation, video and songs. After each lesson
there will be a practice section with questions from the video and
opportunities to practice. The questions will be multiple choice with
audio pronunciations for options if applicable. These practice tests are
not scored, but a user cannot proceed to the next question until they
have selected the correct answer. To be clear, if an answer has an
associated sound then it will play when the user selects the answer
from the list. This way they can both see the answer and hear it.

Every X number of questions an ad will play. This ad will be full-screen
vertical mobile format video. These will be carefully curated to allow
every audience to approve of the content. Therefore no normal ad network
can be used. Instead rabbis, yeshivas, speakers and others will submit
ads to be included in mobile video format with an associated link.
One ad to be produced and included will advertise the prayer mode
feature of the app (desribed later.) The purpose of this ad is to engage
users in the importance of prayers of thanksgiving and prayers for the
nation of Israel and the Jewish people.

Clicking anywhere on the video will take the user to the site
recommended by the ad. A small countdown button in the corner will
allow the user to skip the video after 10 seconds. Sephardic or common
Israeli pronouciation will be used since it allows both for Torah
study and modern Hebrew usage. Every 2 lessons there will be a unit
test. These unti tests are scored and the user is given 1-5 stars for
the content in the unit. These scores can be viewed in the My Grades
section.

## 2. Technological Considerations (✅)

Several different languages and frameworks were considered for
development. With the decision to go with Flutter for the
core application with the [Hive](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/README) plugin
for storing student progress and scores. 
Lesson plans, practice questions and tests are stored in JSON format. [SynFig
Studio](https://www.synfig.org/) is being used to create animations for
videos. And the wonderful [OpenShot Video
Editor](https://www.openshot.org) is being used to combine the lesson
videos and create the final HD lessons.

## 3. Writing Lesson Plans (Current Stage) (✅)

In order to teach the most common words I needed a way to objectively
select the best examples for the lessons. Hebrew University's word
frequency database was used along with the Tanakh and Siddur. You
can read more about this process here:

https://github.com/hexatridecimal/learnNikud/tree/main/data

With the statistical data for word and nikud usage in hand I began
writing the [lesson
plans](https://github.com/hexatridecimal/learnNikud/raw/main/data/lesson_plans/Learn%20Nikud%20-%20Lesson%20Plans.odt). These are written in [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
Writer. The writing guide is [available
here](https://github.com/hexatridecimal/learnNikud/tree/main/data/lesson_plans).

## 4. Review by Native Speakers (☑️)

```
  הָפֵ֣ר מַ֖חֲשָׁבוֹת בְּאֵ֣ין ס֑וֹד וּבְרֹ֖ב יוֹעֲצִ֣ים תָּקֽוּם
  Plans are foiled for lack of counsel, but they are established through
    many advisers.
  - Mishle 15:22
```

In this stage the lesson plans will be submitted to native speakers to
ensure the material is effecticely teaching a student the correct way.

### Recording App

In order to make the answers and sound/speech recordings quickly and easily
I created the Learn Nikud Pronunciation Recording App available here:

https://github.com/hexatridecimal/learnNikud/tree/main/data/pronunciation_recording_app

See the recording guide:

[![Nikud Pronunciation Sound Collection App](http://img.youtube.com/vi/z1mszMaORAI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1mszMaORAI "Nikud Pronunciation Sound Collection App")

This way native speakers can critique the lesson plans, edit them
and provide native recordings of pronunciations.

## 5. Video Editing and Production (☑️)

Each lesson for each video will be edited and put together in OpenShot
 and rendered to 1080x1920 mobile video format. Recording files
made by the recording app will be used where necessary.

## 6. App Development (☑️)

The basic framework of the Flutter App is complete but the next stage will
be to convert the lesson plans to JSON and have the app "play" each
lesson. This will include scoring the practice and tests of each lesson
and unit.

## 7. Beta Testing and Launch (☑️)

A version will be released to the Apple App Store and Google Play for
iOS and Android respectively. Initial user feedback and iteration will
be agressively pursued to create a polished and final product.

# How Can I Help?

Every level of help is needed! We need native speakers to critique the
content, animators to create the videos, beta testers to try it out, and
app developers to help with code. This is an open source project! You
can start anytime and send in pull requests. Please see the section on
